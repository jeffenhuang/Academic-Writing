Thus, the goal of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of the AHP's support for decision making related to SD, thus making it possible to identify gaps and future research pathways. To do so, this research presents (1) an investigation on the international academic literature on the AHP and SD, considering the timeframe 2014–2018; (2) a bibliometric analysis of the international academic literature in these fields within the timeframe established; (3) a summary of the AHP and SD research topics; (4) a mental map of the application areas, linking each to manuscripts individually; (5) an in-depth analysis of the most cited manuscripts; and (6) an in-depth analysis of the most recent manuscripts covering these topics, whose respective journals have higher Journal Citation Index (JCR) classifications.
